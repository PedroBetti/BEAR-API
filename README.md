# BEAR-API
This is the back-end sever run tensorflow AI model script run in conjuncture with BEAR-WebApp.
Currently this is not being used or hosted due to the large size of isntalling all the requirements to run it, and the fact that it was written with being
deployed on Amazon Web Services.

If you want to run this on your local host you need to install the requirements.txt file, then make sure you have nltk, tensorflow2, and ktrain.

Once it is running on your local host you can call it as an API.
